- Describe the files
Contains necessary SUMO simulaiton to run the simulation for the particular region.

- Steps to generate the files
We have used OSM Web Wizard to generate the files. In OSM Web Wizard select the required map and duration in seconds to generate the simulation files. Cars Scale can be lowered or increased too.

- Where it is used
We use sumo config files of these simulation files to run the simulation and collect data. Also the network files in the these simulation files are used to collect edge id details.
